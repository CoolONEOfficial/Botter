 This class purpose is to receive the updates from Telegram and to deliver them to said dispatcher.
 It also runs in a separate thread, so the user can interact with the bot.
 The updater can be started as a polling service or, for production, use a webhook to receive updates.
 This is achieved using the Webhooks and Longpolling classes.
